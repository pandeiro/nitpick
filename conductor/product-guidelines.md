# Product Guidelines: Nitpick

## Design Philosophy
Nitpick adheres to a "functional minimalism" philosophy. The interface should be invisible, existing only to present content as clearly and efficiently as possible. Every UI element must justify its existence through utility.

## Voice and Tone
- **Minimalist & Subtle:** Prose should be extremely brief. Avoid conversational filler, elaborate explanations, or editorializing.
- **Invisible & Functional:** Communication (release notes, about pages) should focus strictly on "what" and "how," never "why." Use bulleted lists of functional changes.
- **Zero Friction:** Documentation and help text are hidden by default in a dedicated section to keep the main browsing experience entirely clear of instructional clutter.

## Visual Identity
- **Monochrome & High-Contrast:** A clean, stark aesthetic that prioritizes content readability. Use a limited, purposeful color palette.
- **Modernized Minimal:** Streamlined layouts with purposeful whitespace. Avoid unnecessary borders, shadows, or decorative elements that do not aid in content consumption.
- **Stark Typography:** Prioritize legible, system-agnostic fonts that emphasize hierarchy and information density.

## Interaction Patterns
- **Gestural & Subtle:** Power-user features (like Pinned Tweets or List management) should utilize hover states, keyboard shortcuts, and unobtrusive icons.
- **Context-Aware:** Controls should only appear when relevant to the user's current task or intent, maintaining a distraction-free environment.
- **Performance-First:** Animations should be rare, purposeful, and instantaneous to maintain the feel of a high-performance utility.
