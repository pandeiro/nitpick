# Initial Concept

Nitpick is a permanent fork of Nitter, an alternative Twitter front-end. It targets power users who want advanced features like chronological feeds and follow lists. It includes a "Pinned Tweets" personal archive, allowing users to save and view specific tweets locally. It aims to modernize the Nitter UI while maintaining its privacy-focused, lightweight nature. All persistent data is stored in the user's local Redis instance.
