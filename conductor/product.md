# Initial Concept

Nitpick is a permanent fork of Nitter, an alternative Twitter front-end. It targets power users who want advanced features like chronological feeds, follow lists, and a "Pinned Tweets" personal archive. It aims to modernize the Nitter UI while maintaining its privacy-focused, lightweight nature. All persistent data will be stored in Redis.
